 Categories

 Plug-ins should avoid using Objective-C categories to override methods of
 classes in public frameworks. If multiple plug-ins attempt to override the
 same method of the same class, only one override takes effect, leading to
 unpredictable behavior.

 Therefore, the functions located here are not in a NSData/NSMutableData
 category of their own.
