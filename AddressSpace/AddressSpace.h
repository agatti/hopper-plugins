/**
 * Address Space Management tool plugin.
 *
 * This tool plugin currently allows to map the full address space of the CPU
 * chosen for the currently loaded file.  When dealing with firmware images and
 * the like, especially on older architectures, the code already assumes a
 * certain memory layout and memory amount.  If a block of code is loaded at a
 * particular address and points to absolute memory locations it is a bit of a
 * pain to handle the situation in Hopper since there is no way (that I know of)
 * to create a segment from the UI.  This plugin solves this very specific
 * situation.
